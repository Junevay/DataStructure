Science writer Gleick takes a panoramic approach to the fourth dimension， a subject that fascinated the fin de siècle scientific world。 He begins with HG Wells drafting his landmark 1895 book The Time Machine。 He includes Edith Nesbit， a Wells contemporary， who invented a time-travel subgenre in her 1906 novel The Story of the Amulet。
